## 📌 Project Idea

To build, containerise, and monitor a functional healthcare webservice. The 
entire stack, including the application and its monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana), will run 
locally using Kubernetes.

## 📌 Project Objective

This project involves creating a webservice that allows people to reserve an appointment with a doctor, stores the 
user data, and handles redirects. You will then instrument this service to expose custom 
performance metrics. Finally, you will use Prometheus to collect these metrics and Grafana to 
build a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing the service's health and usage patterns.
