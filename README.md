## 📌 1. Project Overview

### 🎯 Project Idea
To build, containerize, and monitor a working healthcare webservice. The entire stack — app + monitoring — runs locally on Kubernetes.

### 🎯 Project Objective
The system allows users to reserve doctor appointments, authenticate securely, and interact with a simple GUI.
Custom metrics are exposed, collected with Prometheus, and visualized using Grafana dashboards.

### 🏥 Healthcare Requirement
The system is built with a daily update cycle, aligning with healthcare environments that continuously add features, doctors, and services.
